# Awesome Lean 4 [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Lean is a functional programming language that makes it easy to write correct
> and maintainable code. You can also use Lean as an interactive theorem
> prover. Lean programming primarily involves defining types and functions.
> This allows your focus to remain on the problem domain and manipulating its
> data, rather than the details of programming.
